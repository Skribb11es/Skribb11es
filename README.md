### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I got started with development in 2015 through both school and the Roblox exploiting community
### My current main project is BlindSide a Lua and PhP based whitelist developed for A_003 and his script PF-PWNER [blindside.website](https://blindside.website/)
### In my oppinion skidding is fine as long as you get somthing from it. There is no reason to steal someone else's work and not learn from it.
